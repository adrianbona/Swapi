Using create-react-app(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and this Star Wars API:https://swapi.co/ create a grid of 4 columns that contains a thumbnail with film titles. The grid can be reorganized to be ordered by released date or by episode number. When you click on the thumbnail it should open a detail view that shows: Title, director, producer, episode id, opening crawl, species and characters. Each character should link to the character url.
